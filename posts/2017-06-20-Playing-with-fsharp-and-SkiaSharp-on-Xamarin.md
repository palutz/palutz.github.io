This is time I'm trying to use F# with [SkiaSharp](https://github.com/mono/SkiaSharp) the .Net wrapper of the nice [Skia Library](https://skia.org/) a 2D Graphic Library from Google, in [Xamrin](https://xamarin.com) more precisely with [Xamarin Forms](https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/xamarin-forms), a cross-platform framework to easily develop native mobile application on iOS, Android and other platforms.

Despite it looks like Xamarin and Microsoft decided to drop the support for F# with Xamarin Forms, I think there is a lot of potential on using a functional languages, and in this case F#, to create also client application, thanks to the domain oriented code you can produce easier wuth a language like F# (not to mention, using a F#'s feature like ***mailbox processor***

Please take a look at the code and bear in mind is just a little trial.
