Few days ago I was sharing my talk about [intro to functional programming](./2017-05-19-Make-functions-great-again.html), and today, with a perfect timing, they just published my first interview about my other passion/focus nowadays: distributed (decentralized actually) systems, in particular DLT (Distributed Ledger Technologies) got from my love for Bitcoin.

I have to apology in advance: I was pretty ill that day, so my crappy English got even worst.

I hope you will enjoy what I was trying to say more than how I said it. If so, maybe you will enjoy even more the book where me, alongside other amazing Blockchain early adopters, we share our thoughts about the future of the Blockchain.
