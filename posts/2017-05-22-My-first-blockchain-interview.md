A few days ago I was sharing my talk about [intro to functional programming](./2017-05-19-Make-functions-great-again.html), and today, with a perfect timing, they just published my first interview about my other passion/focus nowadays: distributed (decentralised actually) systems, in particular, DLT (Distributed Ledger Technologies) got from my love for Bitcoin.

I have to apology in advance: I was pretty ill that day, so my crappy English got even worse.

I hope you will enjoy what I was trying to say more than how I said it. If so, maybe you will enjoy even more the book where me, alongside other amazing Blockchain early adopters, we share our thoughts about the future of the Blockchain.

You can find my [Blockchain billions](https://blockchainbillionspodcast.com/) interview [here](https://blockchainbillionspodcast.com/2017/05/22/stefano-paluello/) and here more info about the [book](https://blockchainbillionspodcast.com/book/)
