Last day I've  discovered, by chance, a "new" feature from [Gitlab](www.gitlab.com): Gitlab pages.

[Gitlab pages](https://about.gitlab.com/features/pages/) is exactly what you could expect from the name: the Giltab's version of the quite famous [Github pages](https://pages.github.com/).

So, why bother the change?

First, it could be nice to try something new, but mainly cause Gitlab pages comes with maybe less fancy presentations but more templates and a wider support of different [generators](https://gitlab.com/pages), while Github pages focus only on [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).

And since I'm using [Hakyll](https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/), it looked like a natural choice (other than I'm already using Gitlab for som eof my projects...).
So, let's move on...

Keeping **GIT**...
