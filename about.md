#### *palutz (aka Stefano)*

First of all, thank you for stopping by and welcome to my little website/blog.

I'm an Italian curious geek, polyglot developer, Agile practitioner, eager to learn new things, and always trying to improve my own skills.
I like to deal with different people, different ideas and trying to get the best from any situations.

Travelled quite a bit and lived in different countries, I worked with different companies, from enterprises (like [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com) ) to really early stage startups.

Other than my geek life, I enjoy spending time with my family, my dog(s), trying to teach coding to young people and… And what??? I still didn’t find a way to have 48hr day :-)

I like sports and motorbike (I’m Italian, hence you will understand my love for Ducati), I’m vegetarian and interested in using the technologies to disrupt old businesses and/or improve our life, not just faster or, arguably, richer.

> Use technologies to live better!
