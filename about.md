### $ **whoami_**
#### *palutz (aka Stefano)*
<p>First of all, thank you for stopping by and welcome to my little website/blog.</p>
&nbsp;  
<p>I'm an Italian curious geek, polyglot developer, Agile practitioner, eager to learn new things, 
and always trying to improve my own skills.</p>
<p>I like to deal with different people, different ideas and trying to get the best from any situations.
I believe in the "right tool for the right job" so I prefer to learn and use different technologies than stick with only one.
</p>
<p>
I like the Agile principles and I believe in a strong and good team to achieve the best results, and for that, I’m always trying to improve my communication and interpersonal skills.
</p>
<p>
Other than my geek life, I enjoy spending time with my family, my dog(s), trying to teach coding to young people and… And what??? I still didn’t find a way to have 48hr day :-)</p>
I like sports and motorbike (I’m Italian, so you can understand my love for Ducati), I’m vegetarian and interested in using the technologies to live better.
</p>
