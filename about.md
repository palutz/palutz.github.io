<p>I'm an Italian curious geek, polyglot developer, Agile practitioner, eager to learn new things, 
and always trying to improve my own skills.</p>
<p>I believe in the "right tool for the right job" so I prefer to learn and use different technologies than stick with only one.</p>
<p>I like the Agile principles and I believe in a strong and good team to achieve the best results, 
and for that I'm always trying to improve my communication and interpersonal skills.
</p>
<p>
Other than my geek life, I enjoy spending time with family, with my dog(s), trying to teach coding to young people and... And what??? I still didn't find a way to have 48hrr day :-)</p>
<p>
I like sports and motorbike (I'm italian so you can understand my love for Ducati), I'm vegeterian and interested on using the technologies to live better.
